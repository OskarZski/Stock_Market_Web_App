# STOCK MARKET WEB APP
Web App for Stock Quotes &amp; Live News Stream; Building a Portfolio Using Python &amp; Django

## Purpose
* This is my first big project to develop a full stack app on my won.
* It is a web application for stock market data. Users can get real-time stock data and market news via Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, and Stock News APIs.
* Creation of personal stock portfolios and a live streaming news feed are the first features.
* Adding charts visualization and implementing machine learning to analyze stocks will be the second goal, when I expand this app in the near future.
